# Predicting-Body-Mass-Index-BMI-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This study looked into the validity and precision of employing different machine learning methods to classify BMI.

•	Comprehend the dataset.
•	Create classification models for predicting various BMI categories. 
•	Additionally, tune the hyperparameters and compare the assessment metrics of different classification methods.


A number of significant results from the study have improved our comprehension of the data and how different machine learning algorithms perform with this specific dataset. Below is a summary of some of the project's major results:

• Firstly, the dataset was relatively small, containing approximately 500 samples. However, after preprocessing, which involved dropping 0.6% of the data samples, the dataset was deemed suitable for further analysis.

• Secondly, we discovered that the samples were somewhat imbalanced after preprocessing. To address this issue, we applied the SMOTE technique to balance the classes, which added 36.6% more samples to the dataset.

• Thirdly, visualizing the distribution of the data and the relationships between the features provided us with valuable insights into the feature-set and helped us to better understand the data.

• Fourthly, feature selection and elimination were performed, and the most relevant features were shortlisted, leading to improved model performance.
• Fifthly, we tested multiple algorithms, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and this allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of how the different algorithms performed on this specific dataset.

• Sixthly, we found that the LR, Random Forest Classifier, and XG-Boosting algorithms performed exceptionally well on the current dataset, especially when considering the recall score as the key metric.

Overall, the project demonstrated the importance of carefully preprocessing data and performing feature selection to obtain optimal results. The use of the SMOTE technique also proved to be a useful tool for balancing imbalanced datasets.
